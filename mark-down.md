# Mark-down

**markdown is a lightweight and easy-to-use syntax for styling all forms of writing on the GitHub platform.**
**its a way to style text on the web. You control the display of the document; formatting words as bold or italic, adding images, and creating lists are just a few of the things we can do with Markdown. Mostly, Markdown is just regular text with a few non-alphabetic characters thrown in, like # or*.**
