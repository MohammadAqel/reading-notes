# Introductory HTML and JavaScript

## HTML Structure

**HTML Uses Elements to Describe the Structure of Pages**

* Each element has an opening tag and a closing tag.

* The < !DOCTYPE html > declaration defines that this document is an HTML5 document
* The < html > element is the root element of an HTML page
* The < head> element contains meta information about the HTML page
* The < title > element specifies a title for the HTML page (which is shown in the browser's title bar or in the page's tab)
* The < body> element defines the document's body, and is a container for all the visible contents, such as headings, paragraphs, images, hyperlinks, tables, lists, etc.
* The < h1> element defines a large heading
* The < p> element defines a paragraph




***Attributes provide additional information about the contents of an element. They appear on the opening tag of the element and are made up of two parts: a name and a value, separated by an equals sign.***

## Extra Markup
**HTML Comments** are not displayed in the browser, but they can help document your HTML source code.

We can add comments to our HTML source by using the following syntax:    
< !-- Write your comments here -->

**ID Attribute**
* The HTML id attribute is used to specify a unique id for an HTML element.

* You cannot have more than one element with the same id in an HTML document.

* Its value should start with a letter or an underscore (not a
number or any other character).
***Example: < p id="pullquote">***



**Class Attribute**
* The HTML class attribute is used to specify a class for an HTML element.

* Multiple HTML elements can share the same class.

    **Exapmle: < p class="important">**


**Block Elements**

  Some elements will alwaysappear to **start on a new line** in
the browser window. These are known as **block level** elements.

Here are the block-level elements in HTML:

< address>< article>< aside>< blockquote>< canvas>< dd>< div>< dl>< dt>< fieldset>< figcaption>< figure><  footer>< form>< h1>-< h6>< header>< hr>< li>< main>< nav>< noscript>< ol>< p>< pre>< section>< table>< tfoot>< ul>< video>

**Inline Elements**

* An inline element does not start on a new line.

* An inline element only takes up as much width as necessary.

Examples of inline elements are
< a>, < b>, < em>, and < img>.



**Grouping Text & Elements In a Block**
* The **< div>** element allows you to group a set of elements together in one block-level box.

* The < div> tag is used as a container for HTML elements - which is then styled with CSS or manipulated with JavaScript.

**< span>**
* The < span> tag is an inline container used to mark up a part of a text, or a part of a document.

* The < span> tag is much like the < div> element, but < div> is a block-level element and < span> is an **inline** element.

It is used to either:
1. Contain a section of text where there is no other suitable element to differentiate it from its surrounding text.
2. Contain a number of inline elements.

**IFrames** < iframe> 
An iframe is like a little window that has been cut into your
page.
One common use of iframes is to **embed a Google Map into a page.**

**meta**
< meta> tags always go inside the < head> element, and are typically used to specify character set, page description, keywords, author of the document, and viewport settings.


### HTML5 Layout
HTML5 introduces a new set of elements that allow you to divide up the parts of a page. The names of these elements indicate the kind of content
you will find in them. They are still subject to change, but that has not stopped many web page authors using them already.

**Headers & Footers**
The main header or footer that appears at the top or
bottom of every page on the site.

 A header or footer for an individual < article> or
< section> within the page.

**Navigation** < nav>
The < nav> tag defines a set of navigation links.

**Articles** 
The < article> tag specifies independent, self-contained content.

**aside**
The < aside> tag defines some content aside from the content it is placed in.
