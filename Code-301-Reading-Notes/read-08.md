#  SQL

SQL stand for Structured Query Language and it is a language designed to allow both technical and non-technical users query, manipulate, and transform data from a relational database

*  SQL databases provide safe and scalable storage for millions of websites and mobile applications.

* relational database represents a collection of related (two-dimensional) tables. Each of the tables are similar to an Excel spreadsheet, with a fixed number of named columns (the attributes or properties of the table) and any number of rows of data

1.  we need to write `SELECT` statements To retrieve data from a SQL database
```
SELECT column, another_column, …
FROM mytable;
```

```
Select query for all columns
SELECT * 
FROM mytable;

```

2. we need to use a `WHERE` clause in the query to filter certain results 

* full-text search is best left to dedicated libraries like `Apache Lucene` or `Sphinx`. These libraries are designed specifically to do full text search, and as a result are more efficient and can support a wider variety of search features including internationalization and advanced queries


3. the `DISTINCT` keyword. which  SQL provides a convenient way to discard rows that have a duplicate column and it will blindly remove duplicate rows, value by this order

* SQL provides a way to sort your results by a given column in ascending or descending order using the ORDER BY clause

* The LIMIT will reduce the number of rows to return, and the optional OFFSET will specify where to begin counting the number rows from

```
SELECT column, another_column, …
FROM mytable
WHERE condition(s)
ORDER BY column ASC/DESC
LIMIT num_limit OFFSET num_offset;
```

#### Inserting rows

* we need to use an `INSERT `statement

#### Updating rows

*  using an `UPDATE` statement. Similar to the `INSERT` statement

####  Deleting rows

* use a `DELETE` statement

#### Creating tables

* using the `CREATE TABLE` statement

### Altering tables

`ALTER TABLE` statement to add, remove, or modify columns and table constraints.

### Dropping tables

`DROP TABLE` statement

**Filtering and sorting Query results**

Even though the data in a database may be unique, the results of any particular query may not be – take our Movies table for example, many different movies can be released the same year. In such cases, SQL provides a convenient way to discard rows that have a duplicate column value by using the **DISTINCT** keyword.

```js
Select query with unique results
SELECT DISTINCT column, another_column, …
FROM mytable
WHERE condition(s);
```

**Ordering results**
SQL provides a way to sort your results by a given column in ascending or descending order using the ORDER BY clause.

```js
Select query with ordered results
SELECT column, another_column, …
FROM mytable
WHERE condition(s)
ORDER BY column ASC/DESC;
```
**Limiting results to a subset**
Another clause which is commonly used with the ORDER BY clause are the LIMIT and OFFSET clauses,

```js
Select query with limited rows
SELECT column, another_column, …
FROM mytable
WHERE condition(s)
ORDER BY column ASC/DESC
LIMIT num_limit OFFSET num_offset;
```
