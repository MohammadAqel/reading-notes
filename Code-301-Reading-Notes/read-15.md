# When Women Stopped Coding
* The share of women in computer science started falling at roughly the same moment when personal computers started showing up in U.S. homes in significant numbers.

* In the 1990s, researcher Jane Margolis interviewed hundreds of computer science students at Carnegie Mellon University
  She found that families were much more likely to buy computers for boys than for girls — even when their girls were really interested in computers 
  
  # Why diversity matters to your tech company

*  it’s helpful to identify why diversity and inclusion matters to you and your company specifically

1. Diverse teams are smarter and more creative : Study after study in fields like organizational science, psychology and education indicate that diversity offers significant benefits for teams focused on creativity and innovation. According to Scott E. Page, professor of complex systems, political science and economics at the University of Michigan: "Diverse groups of people bring to organizations more and different ways of seeing a problem and, thus, faster/better ways of solving it."

2. Diverse companies perform better
 researchers found “female representation in top management leads to an increase of $42 million in firm value.”

3. Companies are losing out on great talent 
    Many tech companies pride themselves on creating environments where "the best idea wins." By attracting diverse candidates and designing interviewing processes that ensure a level playing field, companies have a better chance of ensuring the best idea is at the table. 

4. Diverse companies can better serve a diverse user base
