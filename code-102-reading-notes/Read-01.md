A text editor is a piece of software that you download and install on
your computer, or you access online through your web browser, that
allows you to write and manage text.

the most important features in the text editor are: 1.) code completion; 2.) syntax
highlighting; 3.) a nice variety of themes (to reduce eye strain and
fatigue); and 4.) the ability to choose from a healthy selection of
extensions available when you need them.
